						</div>
						<p>RoveCrest is an engineering design team at the University of California, Davis dedicated to building a Mars Rover for competition at the annual University Rover Challenge. Hosted by the Mars Society, the concept of this challenge entails building a rover that could work alongside human researchers on the Red Planet, a cause that we at RoveCrest are committed to working towards.</p>
						<p>Founded in the academic year of 2019-2020, RoveCrest was conceived as a multidisciplinary team where students from all majors and fields of interest could pursue their passion for space exploration. Last year, we successfully cleared the first stage of the competition, and as the club progresses into its second year, we aim to improve and iterate upon our initial designs to build a robust rover that can win the competition and contribute to humanity's space effort, making strides into the next frontier of space exploration one wheel at a time.</p>
